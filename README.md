# CO2emission_prediction
This prediction model takes in the size of the engine from the user and predicts the amount of CO2 emitted from the given engine size. This ML model could be of use for the consumers that want to buy their next car. Since you insist on driving, how about picking one that has a lower environmental impact. It can also be used to answer questions like, 'How much CO2 should be emitted into the air to keep the air pollution in check?'

This model uses the data from kaggle; CO2 emission in Canda

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=CO2+Emissions_Canada.csv

The data includes vehicle type and its model, engine type, size and other features about each vehicle type. This model is created using linear regression as it best fits the trend and gives the most accurate results. It can be seen that there is a linear realtion between engine size and co2 emission. As the size of engine increases, CO2 emission increases linearly as well. As larger engines take more amount of fuel and therefore emits larger amounts of CO2.

The linear graph of engine size and CO2 emission is given as:
